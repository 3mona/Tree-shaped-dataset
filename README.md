Tree-Shaped Network Dataset
====================================

This repository contains datasets of tree-shaped networks developed by [Mona A. Ahmed, Omar M. Salim, Mahmoud Adel Hassan, Hassen Taher Dorrah, Walaa Ibrahim Gabr. 2024]. 

Tree network dataset include natural plant trees and tree-shaped watersheds. This dataset are used to determine the degree of tree-shaped network similarity. The tree-shaped watershed networks are collected from geographical maps. Both inner and outer structure of tree-shaped watershed are considered for similarity analysis and measure.

Natural plant tree images are collected from Pinterest. Images are labeled and divided into seven clusters for CNN classification model as follows:
0 -Columnar
1 - Irregular
2- Open
3- Oval
4- Pyramidal
5- Round 
6- Spreading
